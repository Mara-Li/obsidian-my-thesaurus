# My Thesaurus
-> [French README](./README.fr.md)

Automagically adds tags based on a thesaurus CSV or a Markdown table.

The plugin searches for the word or series of words in the header (properties), body and title of the note. The word searched for will be :
- Strictly (without right or left truncation),
- Case-insensitive (upper or lower case)
- Accent-sensitive (configurable)

> [!TIP]
> - `game` finds `GAME` or `GamE`.
> - `card game` finds `Card Game` but not `cards games` 
> - `game` won't find `games`, `gaming` or `gameplay` 
> - `cafe` will not find `caf√©`.
> - `caf√©` will not find `cafe`.


## üìö Thesaurus Format

The thesaurus must be a table with at last two columns: one for the terms and one for the synonyms. The first row must contain the column headers.

> [!TIP]  
> The thesaurus can be a CSV file like this:
> ```csv
> Tag,Synonym
> computer,PC
> computer,machine
> computer,bike
> ```
>
> Or in Markdown format:
> ```markdown
> | Tag       | Synonym   |
> |-----------|-----------|
> | computer  | PC        |
> | computer  | machine   |
> | computer  | processor |
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to use a markdown file, the Markdown table must be the only content in the file.
> But, you can have a frontmatter at the beginning of the file.

You can have as many synonyms as you want for a term, but you need to duplicate the term in the first column. Moreover, a synonym can be associated with multiple terms, and the synonym can equal to the term itself.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

1. <ins>Thesaurus</ins>: Path to the file containing the thesaurus. The file must be a CSV file and must be in your vault. You can click on the `save` button to ensure the file is valid (the path is correct, the file exists, and it's well-formed).

> [!CAUTION]  
> If, for some reason, the file is moved, you need to update the path in the settings! It won't be updated automatically.

2. <ins>Separator</ins>: The separator used in the CSV file. Supported separators are `,`, `;`, `|`, `tabulation` and `markdown`. See the note above for the markdown separator.
3. <ins>Column title</ins>: The title of the column in the CSV file that contains the tags:
    - **Term**: Name of the tag column **to be added**
    - **Synonyms**: Name of the column of **words to be searched in the file** (contents and file title).
4. <ins>Included paths</ins>: Files in these folders will be included when using the command `My Thesaurus: Parse all files`. You can separate the paths with a comma, semicolon, or newline. Moreover, regex is supported.

> [!TIP]  
> You can include all the files in your vault by using `.*` as the path!

5. <ins>Excluded terms</ins>: Allow to exclude term using a frontmatter key. Include two settings:
    - **Frontmatter key**: The key to search in the frontmatter, by default `exclude_term`
    - **Auto-clean**: If enabled, the plugin will clean the already existing tags with removing the excluded terms.
6. <ins>Remove accents</ins>: If enabled, accents will be suppressed when searching for synonyms. Allows `caf√©` to be recognized by `cafe` (and vice versa).


## üìù Usage

The plugin has two commands:

1. <ins>My Thesaurus: Parse all files</ins>: This command will parse all the files in the included paths and add the tags based on the thesaurus. At the end, a message will be displayed with the results, including:
    - **Errors**: The files that encountered an error and the specific error message.
    - **Skipped files**: The files that have been skipped because no synonym was found.
    - **Success**: The files that have been successfully parsed, along with the tags that have been added.
2. <ins>My Thesaurus: Parse current file</ins>: This command will parse the current file and add the tags based on the thesaurus.
