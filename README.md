# My Thesaurus  

Automagically adds tags based on a thesaurus CSV.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings  

1. <ins>Separator</ins>: The separator used in the CSV file. Supported separators are `,`, `;`, `|`, and `tabulation`.  
2. <ins>Column title</ins>: The title of the column in the CSV file that contains the tags:  
    - **Term**: The column contains the tags that must be set by the plugin.  
    - **Synonyms**: The column contains the synonyms that must be recognized by the plugin.  
3. <ins>Thesaurus</ins>: Path to the file containing the thesaurus. The file must be a CSV file and must be in your vault. You can click on the `save` button to ensure the file is valid (the path is correct, the file exists, and it's well-formed).  

> [!WARNING]  
> If, for some reason, the file is moved, you need to update the path in the settings! It won't be updated automatically.  

5. <u>Included paths</u>: Files in these folders will be included when using the command `My Thesaurus: Parse all files`. You can separate the paths with a comma, semicolon, or newline. Moreover, regex is supported.  

> [!TIP]  
> You can include all the files in your vault by using `.*` as the path!  

## üìù Usage  

The plugin has two commands:  

1. <ins>My Thesaurus: Parse all files</ins>: This command will parse all the files in the included paths and add the tags based on the thesaurus. At the end, a message will be displayed with the results, including:  
    - **Errors**: The files that encountered an error and the specific error message.  
    - **Skipped files**: The files that have been skipped because no synonym was found.  
    - **Success**: The files that have been successfully parsed, along with the tags that have been added.  
2. <ins>My Thesaurus: Parse current file</ins>: This command will parse the current file and add the tags based on the thesaurus.
